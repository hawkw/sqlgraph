# Tests will go here...eventually

# I'm considering using doctest (https://docs.python.org/3/library/doctest.html#module-doctest)
# rather than unittest for some/all of the testing since it seems to be both easier and more semantic.
# It also forces us to write specs in documentation, which I for one think is kind of awesome.
